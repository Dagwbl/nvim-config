# Learning note

## `g` means Go to

- `gi`: Got to the last place you entered Insert mode.
-

## Z Mode

The `z` menu mode is an eclectic mix of cursor positioning, code folding, and random command.

**Never use the arrow keys to move the cursor.**

But recognize that if you ever have to push these keys more than twice in succession to move the cursor, you’re wasting keystrokes.

- `ge`: Go to end of previous word.
- `C-i`: To jump forward in history.
- `C-o` To jump forward in history
